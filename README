# Rainbow, a termination proof certification tool
# See the COPYRIGHTS and LICENSE files.

Rainbow is available on the CoLoR web page http://color.inria.fr/.

The aim of Rainbow is to check the correctness of termination
certificates for various existing formats. The certification is
currently done by generating a Coq file based on the CoLoR
library. Coq is a powerful proof assistant and checker (see
http://coq.inria.fr) and CoLoR is a Coq library on rewriting and
termination (see http://color.inria.fr).

TPDB is the Termination Problem Data Base available at
http://dev.aspsimon.org/projects/termcomp/downloads/.

The main program is "convert". See INSTALL to build it. It allows you
to convert one problem/proof file from one format to another one. Do
"convert -h" to learn how to use it. We also provide some useful
scripts in the scripts directory:

- check_coq file.xml: convert a CPF file.xml into file.v and check it with coqc

- rename_tpdb: rename TPDB/CPF files to get valid Coq filenames

Various examples are provided in the directory examples/. Do "[g]make
examples" to compile them.

For checking proofs with Coq, make sure that your ~/.coqrc file
contains the following line, where <dir> is the directory where CoLoR
files have been compiled:

  Add Rec LoadPath "<dir>" as CoLoR.

Command for checking a CPF file:

convert -icpf file.cpf -ocoq > file.v && coqc -dont-load-proofs file.v

Or:

check_coq file.xml

Translation of TPDB variable names into CoLoR
-------------------------------------------------------

A variable in a TPDB rule (resp. equation) [LHS -> RHS | cond1, ...,
condn] (resp. [LHS == RHS]) is translated in CoLoR into a natural
number that is its leftmost position (starting from 0) in the list of
variables, computed in a depth-first manner, of the term
F(LHS,cond1,..,condn,RHS) (resp. F(LHS,RHS)) where F is some arbitrary
new symbol of the appropriate arity.

For instance, the rule f(y,y,x)->g(x,h(y)) is translated to
f(0,0,2)->g(2,h(0)) since the list of variables of the rule is
[y;y;x;x;y]. And the dependency pairs computed in CoLoR are
f(0,0,2)->g(2,h(0)) and f(0,0,2)->h(0).
